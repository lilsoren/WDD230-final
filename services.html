            <p>If you and your spouse are looking for the perfect wedding reception venue, you may stop looking. Our
                hotels provide a convenient and stress-free opportunity to seamlessly plan your special day. The first
                thing about a reception is the food. Our hotels give you the option to book a catering crew through our
                kitchen staff or to bring in outside catering/food of your choosing. In addition, your guests can easily
                book rooms with us, so there is no need to worry about your guest getting lost or being late. Event
                coordinators are available upon request to plan, set up, and help in any way that they can. We offer the
                option of an inside or outside reception as well as access to tables, chairs, and a full set of speakers
                for music and dancing. </p>

            <p>Full-time temple missionaries are given the opportunity to live at our hotel for discounted prices. The
